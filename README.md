# Digifiz Replica User Manuals

[![CI](https://github.com/Sgw32/DR_UserManuals/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Sgw32/DR_UserManuals/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This repository hosts the LaTeX sources for the official documentation shipped with every Digifiz Replica dashboard.  The manuals cover both hardware generations‚Äîthe classic Arduino Mega (ATmega2560) cluster and the Digifiz Next ESP32-based units‚Äîand are kept in sync with the production firmware and wiring harnesses.

## üìò What is inside

- **Full installation and configuration guide** explaining wiring, calibration, firmware flashing, and safety notes for each hardware revision.
- **Feature reference** detailing onboard diagnostics, display modes, warning logic, and localization options available in the latest firmware.
- **Appendices for technicians** with connector pinouts, signal tables, sensor compatibility, and troubleshooting flows collected from the community.

The compiled PDF (`DR_DRNext_User_Manual_mk1_mk2.pdf`) is the master document used for customer deliveries.  Each section of the manual lives in the `chapters/` directory, supporting data and macros reside in `preamble/`, while ancillary assets (figures, tables, and scripts) are stored under `figures/` and `anc/`.

## üöó Hardware overview

Digifiz Replica is a modern replacement for factory VDO clusters in second-generation Volkswagen Group vehicles and now also in classic Audi platforms.  Hundreds of units are already in the field, with active deployments in the USA, Germany, the UK, Italy, Russia, and across the EU.

### Supported vehicles

- **Volkswagen Jetta Mk2 (1984‚Äì1992)** ‚Äî CE1 and CE2 fuse panels
- **Volkswagen Golf Mk2 (1983‚Äì1992)** ‚Äî CE1 and CE2 fuse panels
- **Volkswagen Passat B2 (1984‚Äì1992)** ‚Äî expected compatibility, pending customer confirmation
- **Volkswagen Scirocco 2 (1984‚Äì1992)** ‚Äî requires a contact adapter
- **Audi 80 B2 (1978‚Äì1986)** ‚Äî red and green Digifiz variants
- **Audi 80 Coup√© B2 (1980‚Äì1988)** ‚Äî red and green Digifiz variants

### Firmware and tooling requirements

| Hardware generation | Toolchain | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Arduino Mega / ATmega2560** | Arduino IDE ‚â• 1.8.13 with the board set to **Arduino Mega / ATmega2560**. Use `Ctrl + Shift + U` for USBasp uploads. | Required libraries: `RTClib` (non-Neuron version), `SparkFun EEPROM`, `Adafruit_BusIO`, `MedianFilterLib2`.  `MD_MAX72xx` is obsolete‚Äîdo not install it. |
| **Digifiz Next (ESP32)** | Espressif ESP-IDF v5.2.1 | Follow the flashing instructions in the manual for OTA and USB-C workflows. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the manual locally

1. Install a recent TeX distribution (TeX Live 2025 or newer is recommended) that includes `latexmk`, `pdflatex`/`lualatex`, and `biber`.
2. For the automated figure pipeline, also install `inkscape`, `perl`, `sed`, `uconv`, and `ghostscript`.  These utilities enable vector export and watermark generation used in the PDF.
3. Clone this repository and run:

   ```sh
   latexmk DR_DRNext_User_Manual_mk1_mk2
   ```

   The command builds `DR_DRNext_User_Manual_mk1_mk2.pdf` in the repository root.  Clean builds (`latexmk -C`) and alternative engines can be configured in `.latexmkrc`.

If you prefer cloud editing, you can upload the project to Overleaf.  Select the latest TeX Live compiler and ensure shell-escape is enabled for chapters that render SVG figures.
