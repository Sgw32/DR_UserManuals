\chapter{Labelling, Packaging, and Storage} \label{ch:Summary}

\section{Marking}

Instrument panels may carry a printed model identifier that mirrors the coding described in \Cref{ch:notation}.
Export batches can bear additional markings applied by the importing organisation.
Sealing is not performed; the dashboards are intended for user-serviced installations.

\section{Packaging Recommendations}

Although the official documentation shows numbered packing components, production kits are typically shipped with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bubble-wrap protection around the dashboard assembly.
    \item A rigid cardboard container sized to prevent movement during transport.
\end{itemize}
Alternative packaging is acceptable provided the dashboard and harnesses are immobilised and protected against impact and electrostatic discharge.

\section{Storage and Transportation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Follow the general transport rules defined in GOST~23216-78 for the selected transport mode.
    \item Packaged dashboards may be shipped by road, rail, river, or air.
    \item Store units inside the vehicle cabin or in a dry indoor space between \(+15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) and \(+40\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\), sheltered from direct sunlight. Storage inside the car behind the windscreen is acceptable if the panel remains shaded.
\end{itemize}
