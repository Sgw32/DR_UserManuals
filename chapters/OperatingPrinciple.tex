\ReplicaGenOne{} dashboards reuse the original Volkswagen enclosure, the factory CE~1 or CE~2 connectors, and either the mechanical speedometer cable or an electronic speed sensor.
\ReplicaGenOneShort{} main boards are based on a fiberglass PCB populated with discrete components controlled by an ATmega~2560 microcontroller and MAX~7219 indicator drivers.

\ReplicaNextLong{} builds on an ESP32-S3 system-on-chip and introduces a newly manufactured SLA-printed enclosure, a redesigned front panel and cover, and a connector adapter board.
The \ReplicaNextShort{} display is illuminated by WS2812 addressable LEDs mounted behind the front frame, and the accompanying harness includes the electronic speed sensor by default.

Both generations share the same display layout and MFA pages, ensuring that installation procedures and day-to-day operation remain familiar between hardware revisions.
