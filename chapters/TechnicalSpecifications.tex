The Digifiz Replica dashboard consumes no standby current when powered down. Digifiz Replica Next draws approximately 13~mA from the +12~V supply while the ignition is off, which should be considered when the vehicle is stored for extended periods. Both generations operate reliably from the vehicle electrical system between 9~V and 16~V~DC.

\section{Measurement capabilities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vehicle speed:} measured through the factory cable or electronic speed sensor. The systematic error is 10~km/h, the relative error is 3~km/h, and the indication saturates at 999~km/h (or mph for imperial units).
    \item \textbf{Engine speed:} derived from the ignition signal via an optocoupler stage with a 430~nF/1.2~k\ensuremath{\Omega} RC network and a diode limiter. The absolute and relative errors are within 200~rpm.
    \item \textbf{Fuel level:} read from the resistive tank sender with an uncertainty of approximately 10~litres.
    \item \textbf{Coolant temperature:} indicated qualitatively using the standard thermistor connected through the vehicle harness; quantitative values are not displayed.
    \item \textbf{Timekeeping:} maintained to within one minute.
    \item \textbf{Indicator lamps:} direction indicators, high beam, oil pressure warnings, generator status, handbrake, rear window heating or diesel glow-plug, and front and rear fog lights.
\end{itemize}
